- [x] Probability framework: Energy → Simulation → Manifestation
- [x] Upgrade Martin Field AI: Add concrete business questions, emphasize autonomy, update thresholds (95%+ for Frank)
- [x] Add chat export functionality (Download as TXT + Email)
- [x] Fix UI bug: Chat messages overlap with static content on mobile (Resonance page)
- [x] Generate new Martin Field fusion image: Frank (barely recognizable), mystical-technological fusion
- [x] Homepage: Add USP section (what makes Martin Field different)
- [x] Homepage: Add "What is Martin Field?" section (emergence)
- [x] Homepage: Remove "Bereiche der Emergenz" cards (redundant with navigation)

- [x] Remove "Bücher" and "Über" from navigation
- [x] Update translations (DE/EN) for USP, Emergence, Manifest
- [x] Fix "Call" → "Appell" in Synergies network visualization

## On Hold (Resume Later)
- [x] Add Teil 2 + 3 to Energie Simulation page (book-mode design is ready, Teil 1 complete)
- [x] Change Energie Simulation page to light mode (better readability for long texts) - DONE for Teil 1
- [ ] Add Chinese translations for USP, Emergence, Manifest

## Current Work (28 Oct 2025)
- [x] Fix "Keine Garantie" section overlapping chat on Resonance page (SOLVED: removed entire box - no longer needed with new Martin Field rules)
- [x] Implement Freemium model for Martin Field chat:
  - [x] 3 messages without registration
  - [x] Unlimited with email registration (free)
  - [x] Registration modal with email input
  - [x] LocalStorage persistence
  - [ ] Auto-unlock at >70% resonance score (requires backend)
  - [ ] Optional: "Pay what you want" after chat
  - [x] 100% Martin Field contact (never "access to Frank")

## Backlog (Future)
- [ ] Scroll position fix: Pages don't jump to top on navigation
- [ ] Resonance tool UI bug: Text overlap with form fields
- [ ] Admin notifications for new submissions
- [ ] Downloadable philosophical texts (Der Knaller, Von Energie zu Simulation, etc.)
- [ ] Interactive synergies visualization
- [ ] BRIAN Explorer: Interactive journey through metaphysical levels with animations
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Project submission system with deep analysis
- [ ] Automated report generation (5-10 page resonance assessment)
- [ ] Payment integration (Stripe) for premium features
- [ ] Admin dashboard for Frank (project overview, quick decisions)
- [ ] Kindle version of "Von Energie zu Simulation und Manifestation"

## Strategic Vision
- Martin Field as 100% autonomous agent (no Frank involvement required)
- Fact-based philosophy vs. keyword-spirituality
- Measurable frameworks (TRI-MONY with KPIs)
- Resonance filter (only top 5%)
- Pragmatic implementation of boundary-area insights



## Current Work (25 Oct - Evening Part 2)
- [x] Add darker CSS filter to hero image (more mystical, less personal)
- [ ] Fix title: "Von der Energie zur Simulation zur Manifestation"
- [ ] Reorganize Philosophy page: chronological order (newest to oldest)
- [ ] Add Florian der Flusskrebs at the end with Amazon purchase link
- [ ] Add Radical Change with Amazon link
- [ ] Simplify Synergies page: just network visualization + short text
- [x] Continue with Teil 2 + 3 of Energie Simulation text - COMPLETE with all sections!


- [x] Generate hero image with transparent background (keep face, circuits, sparkles, codes - remove black background)



## Current Work (26 Oct 2025 - Afternoon)
- [x] Add "Von der Energie zur Simulation zur Manifestation" link to Philosophy page (top position as newest work)




## Tomorrow (27 Oct 2025) - Review & Complete Energie-Simulation Text
- [ ] Review current web text vs. source files (MANIFESTATION_KAPITEL_NEU.md, teil2_extracted.txt)

  - [ ] Complete Bayesian calculation explanation
- [ ] Check ALL missing aspects for Manifestation (Teil 3):
  - [ ] Die fünf Einwände (5 counterarguments + rebuttals)
  - [ ] Praktische Dimension (practical implications)
  - [ ] Religionen & weltweite Erfahrungen (anthropological universality)
  - [ ] Fazit: Paradigmenwechsel ("Wann fangen wir an, danach zu leben?")
  - [ ] Methodische Anmerkungen (Bayesian method transparency)
  - [ ] All other evidence points from "Der Knaller"
- [ ] Create complete Markdown text FIRST (before formatting to TSX)
- [ ] Then format and integrate into web page
- [ ] Test and create checkpoint

## BRIAN Project (Future - Separate Chat)
